# Restaurant Website Practice Project

This README provides an overview of the Restaurant Website Practice Project, a web application built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Webpack. This project primarily focuses on demonstrating the use of Webpack for bundling assets and implementing page routing for a restaurant website.

## Project Overview

The Restaurant Website Practice Project is a simple web application that simulates a restaurant website. Its main purpose is to provide a hands-on learning experience for using Webpack to bundle assets and implementing page routing for seamless navigation.

## Webpack Integration

Webpack is used in this project for asset bundling and management. Key features related to Webpack integration include:

- **JavaScript Bundling**: All JavaScript files are bundled into a single output file, reducing the number of HTTP requests and improving performance.

- **CSS Bundling**: CSS files are bundled and optimized for faster page loading.

- **Asset Loading**: Webpack is configured to handle loading of images, fonts, and other assets.
